                    <h3>Coulomb's Law in Action</h3>
                    <p><b>Explanation:</b></p>
                    <blockquote class="gta">
                        <p>Coulomb's Law in action refers to the observable
                            phenomenon where electrically charged particles
                            exert a force of attraction or repulsion on each
                            other, with the strength of this force directly
                            proportional to the product of the charges and
                            inversely proportional to the square of the distance
                            between them; essentially, like charges repel each
                            other while opposite charges attract, and the closer
                            they are, the stronger the force is</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><b> <u>Example:</u></b></p>
                    <p><b>Static electricity: </b> When you rub a balloon on
                        your hair,
                        the balloon gains a charge, and when you bring it near a
                        wall, the opposite charges on the wall are attracted,
                        causing the balloon to stick. </p>
                    <p><b>Lightning: </b>The massive charge
                        separation in the clouds creates a strong electric
                        field, leading to a sudden discharge of electricity
                        (lightning) when the potential difference becomes too
                        large. </p>
                    <p> <b>Attraction between oppositely charged ions: </b> In
                        chemical
                        reactions, positively charged ions (cations) are
                        attracted to negatively charged ions (anions) due to
                        Coulombic forces, forming chemical bonds. </p>

                    <p><b><u>Important factors:</u></b></p>
                    <p><b>(a) Charge magnitude: </b> The greater the charge on each particle,
                    the stronger the force of attraction or repulsion.</p>
                    <p><b>(b) Distance: </b> As the distance between charged particles
                    increases, the force between them rapidly decreases due to
                    the "square of the distance" relationship.</p>

                    <h3><b>How to visualize Coulomb's Law in action: </b></h3>
                    <p><b>Simple experiment:</b></p>
                    <p>Suspend two small charged objects (like Styrofoam balls)
                    near each other using thin threads. Observe how they repel
                    each other if they have the same charge and attract if they
                    have opposite charges.</p>
                    <p><b>Electrostatic field visualization:</b></p>
                    <p>Using a visual representation of electric field lines, you
                    can see how the field lines are denser closer to a charge
                    and spread out as the distance increases, illustrating the
                    inverse square relationship.</p>
