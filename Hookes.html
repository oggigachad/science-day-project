                    <blockquote class="gta">
                        <p>"It states that the force needed to extend or compress a spring (or other elastic object) by some distance is directly proportional to that distance. In simpler terms, the more you stretch or compress something, the more force it pushes back with"</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><b>Mathematical Representation: </b></p>
                    <p>The law is commonly expressed as: <b>F = -kx</b></p>

                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <p>F is the force applied.</p>
                    <p>k is the spring constant (a measure of the stiffness of the material).</p>
                    <p>x is the displacement (the change in length).</p>
                    <p><b>Applications:</b></p>
                    <p>It's crucial in understanding the behavior of springs, but it also applies to various elastic materials.  
                        It's used in many devices, including spring scales, pressure gauges, and mechanical watches.  
                        It is also a basis for understanding how materials react to stress and strain.
