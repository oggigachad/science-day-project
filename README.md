🔬 Science Day Project 🌌
A collection of interactive physics simulations for Science Day demonstrations. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring fundamental physics principles to life through engaging visualizations. 🚀

Key Concepts:

⚡ Coulomb's Law (Electrostatics)
🏋️‍♂️ Hooke's Law (Elasticity)
🌍 Kepler's Laws (Planetary Motion)
🔮 Snell's Law (Refraction)
🌡️ Thermodynamics (Heat Transfer)
Each simulation allows users to explore key physics principles with interactive elements and animations! 🎮

Explore the repo and get hands-on with physics! ✨
