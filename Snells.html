                    <blockquote class="gta">
                        <p>"Snell's law states that when a wave passes from one medium to another, the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant. This law is also known as the law of refraction. "</p>

                    <p><b>How does Snell's law work ?</b></p>
                    <p>• When light passes from one medium to another, it bends or refracts. </p>
                    <p>• The amount of bending depends on the refractive index of the media involved. </p>
                    <p>• The refractive index is a constant value that depends on the color of light and the pair of media. </p>
                    <p>• The refractive index is a constant value that depends on the color of light and the pair of media. </p>

                    <p><b>History of Snell's law</b></p>
                    <p>• The Dutch mathematician and astronomer Willebrord Snell discovered the law in 1621. </p>
                    <p>• René Descartes published the law in 1637. </p>
                    <p>• Snell's law is also known as the Snell-Descartes law, the ibn-Sahl law, and the law of refraction. </p>

                    <p><b>Applications of Snell's law.</b></p>
                    <p>• Snell's law is used in ray tracing.</p>
                    <p>• It's used in experimental optics to find the refractive index of a material.</p>
