                    <p class="intro-text"><b>Thermodynamics</b> is a branch of
                        physics
                        that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their
                        relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties
                        of matter and radiation. The behavior of these
                        quantities is governed by the four laws of
                        thermodynamics, which convey a quantitative description
                        using measurable macroscopic physical quantities, but
                        may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by
                        statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics applies to a wide
                        variety of topics in science and engineering, especially
                        physical chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering
                        and mechanical engineering, but also in other complex
                        fields such as meteorology.</p>

                        Historically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire
                        to increase the efficiency of early steam engines,
                        particularly through the work of French physicist Sadi
                        Carnot (1824) who believed that engine efficiency was
                        the key that could help France win the Napoleonic
                        Wars. Scots-Irish physicist Lord Kelvin was the first
                        to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in
                        1854 which stated,
                        "Thermo-dynamics is the subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies, and the relation of heat to electrical agency."
                        German physicist and mathematician Rudolf Clausius
                        restated Carnot's principle known as the Carnot cycle
                        and gave to the theory of heat a truer and sounder
                        basis. His most important paper,
                        "On the Moving Force of Heat", published in 1850,
                        first stated the second law of thermodynamics. In 1865
                        he introduced the concept of entropy. In 1870 he
                        introduced the virial theorem, which applied to heat.

                        without transfer of matter, the change in internal
                        energy, <b>ΔU</b> , of a thermodynamics system is equal
                        to energy gained as heat, <b>Q</b>, less thermodynamics
                        work, <b>W</b>, done by the system on its surroundings.

                        temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all
                        processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches
                        a minimum value.
